# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made in C# and .NET Framework/Core. Through my studies I become
familiar to proficient in Databases via SQL and Enitity and the creation of MVC applications.

## Projects:

* [Local Theatre Website Live Project](https://github.com/bbtk421/liveprojects/tree/main/csharpliveproject)
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/bbtk421/c--course-work/tree/master/basic_c%23/CarInsurance)
* [Snake Game](https://github.com/bbtk421/non-school-projects/tree/master/csharp/SnekGame)

## Snek Game

```html
This is a Snake clone with a Windows Form Application base UI. Please check the project link above
for the README.md for the game with code snippets.
```

## Local Theatre Website Live Project

```html
This was a two week sprint adding functionality to a simple website for a local theater. My work was 
mostly relating to the calendar section but I also created the responsive nav menu. Please click the 
project link for its code summary.
```

## Car Insurance

```html
This project is an MVC web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input 
on policy information and generates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that 
allows staff to view all quotes that have been issued.

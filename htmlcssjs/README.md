### New Portfolio Site

```html
I made a new portfolio design for myself, from scratch using vanilla CSS. Design wise I decided to go more
clean and readable with a simple completmentary palatte. If you didn't arrive here from my site then you 
can visit it by clicking the "Live Site" link above.

### Local Theatre Website Live Project

This was a two week sprint adding functionality to a simple website for a local theater. My work was 
mostly relating to the calendar section but I also created the responsive nav menu. Please click the

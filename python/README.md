### Python Django Live Project

```html
I created an MVC web app that allows you to add breweies the user has been to along to a database. 
The pages of the site have full CRUD functionality and the index is sortable by any category.
```


### A Timey Wimey Adventure

```html
This is a text based console game with branching paths. Nothing hard but it was great 
with solidfying loops and iterations for me, as well as manupulating the console statements 
for a more natural feel for the user.
```
